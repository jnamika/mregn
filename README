This package implements a gradient-based learning algorithm for mixture of RNN experts.
The package supports
(1) both fully connected and sparsely connected networks,
(2) both discrete-time neural networks and continuous-time neural networks,
(4) multi-threading, and
(5) analyzing some characteristics (ex: Lyapunov spectrum, Kullback-Leibler divergence).



=== Installation ===

First, type `./autogen.sh' in the current directory to create configure file.
Next, type `./configure' and when it finishes, type `make'. This will create `mre-learn', `gn-learn' and `mregn-generate'.
Run them with the argument `-h' to show the usages of them.



=== Example ===

Here is a sample session.

> cd bin
> echo "import gen_target
gen_target.print_comp_Lissajous_08curves(500, 25)" | python > target.txt
> mre-learn -e 30000 -d 3 target.txt
> gn-learn -a -e 10000 -n 20 mre.dat
> mregn-generate -n 1000 mre.dat gn.dat
