This package implements a gradient-based learning algorithm for recurrent neural networks.
The package supports
(1) both fully connected and sparsely connected networks,
(2) both discrete-time neural networks and continuous-time neural networks,
(3) training examples of both symbolic data and floating point numbers,
(4) multi-threading, and
(5) analyzing some characteristics (ex: Lyapunov spectrum, Kullback-Leibler divergence).



=== Installation ===

Type `make' to build the `rnn-learn' and `rnn-generate' programs.
Run them with the argument `-h' to show the usages of them.

There are some other useful programs in this package.



=== Example ===

Here is a sample session.

> cd bin
> echo "import gen_target
gen_target.print_sin_curve(500, 20)" | python > target.txt
> rnn-learn -e 5000 target.txt
> rnn-generate -n 1000 rnn.dat
