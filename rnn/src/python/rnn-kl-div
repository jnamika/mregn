rnn-kl-div  - a program to analyze the Kullback-Leibler divergence that measures the distance between output of a recurrent neural network and test data.

Usage: rnn-kl-div [-s seed] [-n length] [-c samples] [-t truncate-length] [-b block-length] [-d divide-num] [-f rnn-file] test-file ...
Usage: rnn-kl-div [-v] [-h]

Available options are:
-s seed
    \`seed' is the seed for the initialization of random number generator, which specifies a starting point for the random number sequence, and provides for restarting at the same point. If this option is omitted, the current system time is used.
-n length
    Iterations of the dynamics. Default is $length.
-c samples
    Number of samples. Default is $samples.
-t truncate-length
    \`truncate-length' is the time steps before evaluating output of the recurrent neural network in order to discard transient effects. Default is $truncate_length.
-b block-length
    Default is $block_length.
-d divide-num
    Default is $divide_num.
-f rnn-file
    The file \`input-file' being generated by rnn-learn is used for the initialization of recurrent neural network parameters. Default is \`$rnn_file'.

Program execution:
rnn-kl-div computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output of a recurrent neural network and test data. The parameters of the recurrent neural network is given by the rnn-file (ex: rnn.dat) generated by rnn-learn. To evaluate the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the output and data are discretized with respect to \`block-length' and \`divide-num'.
